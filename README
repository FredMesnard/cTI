	cTI: a constraint-based Termination Inference tool for ISO-Prolog


Introduction:
-------------

cTI is an automatic tool for inferring universal left termination conditions
of any ISO-Prolog programs. In other words, given a program,
cTI tries to compute all the modes for all user-defined predicates
which insures that the Prolog processor will give all answers in finite time.
cTI assumes that no infinite rational term is created at run-time 
while running the analyzed program.


Requirements:
-------------

SWI-Prolog >= 8


Installing and running cTI:
---------------------------

Inside the src/ directory, any Prolog source can be analyzed 
from the terminal, e.g.:

	% ./cTI Filex/testapp3.pl    
	...
	predicate_term_condition(rev(A,B),A).
	predicate_term_condition(app(A,B,C),C+A).
	predicate_term_condition(app3(A,B,C,D),A*D+A*B).
	predicate_term_condition(app3bis(A,B,C,D),D).

which means that, wrt the Prolog program Filex/testapp3.pl:
- rev/2 terminates if its first argument is ground,
- app/3 terminates if its first or third argument is ground,
- app3/4 terminates if either its first and fourth arguments are ground
or its first and second argument are ground,
- app3bis terminates if its fourth argument is ground.


Options:
--------

Unknown predicates are assumed to finitely failed, which is the
standard behavior of any ISO-Prolog conforming system.
It is possible to get compatibility with most Prolog dialects
by adding at the beginning of the file:
	:- include_predef('predef_for_compatibility.pl').
By modifying the file predef_for_compatibility.pl,
the user may define its own set of built-ins.
