This directory contains programs from Chapter 11 of Poole, Mackworth
and Goebel, "Computational Intelligence:  A Logical Approach", Oxford
University Press, 1996. All of these programs are copyright Oxford
University Press and Poole, Mackworth and Goebel, 1996.

All of these programs have a similar form
    foo.pl     the main code
    foo_t.pl   test code (sometimes foo_t1.pl, foo_t2.pl, etc)
    foo.tr     tracing of the program on the test data (not Prolog readable)

The following code is present:

Decision Trees Search:
    dtlearn1.pl   binary attributes, myopic max information split, no noise
    dtlearn2.pl   binary attributes, myopic max info split, noise allowed
    dtlearn3.pl   binary attributes, full seach for smallest tree, no noise
    dtlearn4.pl   binary attributes, GINI index, no noise

    dtlearn_t1.pl classification data from Figure 11.2
    dtlearn_t2.pl classification data from Figure 11.2, with Boolean attributes
    dtlearn_t3.pl small Boolean example

Neural Network Learning
    nnlearn.pl    backpropagation learner
    nnlearn2.pl   same as nnlearn.pl, but it prints out a trace

    nnl_t1.pl     classification data from Figure 11.2 (two hidden units)
    nnl_t2.pl     classification data from Figure 11.2 (no hidden units)
    nnl_t2.pl     small Boolean example (same data as dtlearn_t3.pl)
