This directory contains programs from Chapter 7 of Poole, Mackworth
and Goebel, "Computational Intelligence:  A Logical Approach", Oxford
University Press, 1996. All of these programs are copyright Oxford
University Press and Poole, Mackworth and Goebel, 1996.

All of these programs have a similar form
    foo.pl     the main code
    foo_t.pl   test code (sometimes foo_t1.pl, foo_t2.pl, etc)
    foo.tr     tracing of the program on the test data (not Prolog readable)

The following programs are present:
   confl       meta-interpreter to find conflicts
   confl_id    iterative-deepening meta-interpreter to find minimal conflicts
   ineq        meta-interpreter to correctly handle inequality
